## Information

RavenFFT is adapted from the RISCV port of ARM CMSIS library <https://github.com/misaleh/CMSIS-DSP-PULPino.git> and performs a 1024 point Complex FFT on a set of generated complex numbers. This directory also contains tools in `1024_CFFT_FP32/tools/` for generating randomized complex_numbers as an input and validating benchmark output with a python CFFT implementation.

## Build Directions
`make`
