Python tools used to validate output of CFFT.

1. gen_nums.py generates 1024 complex numbers (fmt [real, imaginary]) into random_numbers.txt
2. python_FFT.py reads in input data and executes a complex FFT implemented in python, then generates an output file of the results.
3. compare_outputs.py compares python_FFT output (stored as output file) and RISC-V CFFT output (stored as output file)
